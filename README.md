Blender based UI for OpenFrameworks

This library builds upon the excellent [oui-blendish](https://bitbucket.org/duangle/oui-blendish/overview) library.

For now this is an example openFrameworks app serving as a proof-of-concept. It needs to be refactored into a sane openFrameworks addon and ultimately a more dev friendly C library.

We will add  more functionality to oui-blendish as in its current state it has limited options. For a list of things to enhance see: https://github.com/sphaero/oui-blendish/issues
